# GAME GUIDE
 The game consists of two players.
 Each player is represented by a team of 3 characters.
 Each player can choose from 6 different characters to create his team. 🥷🏻🧙‍♂️🤡🦸🏻‍♀️🎅🏻🧝‍♀️
 
 Each character has a name, a weapon, life points and heal points (personal capacity/skill)
 Each weapon has damage points or heal points (magicPotion).
 
 ## Characters:
 -🥷🏻The ninja has 12 life points and a razor sharp saber that will remove 4 life points
    for each scratch on one of his opponents.
    If he directs his attack on a member of his team, he will use one of the many shiatsu techniques he has mastered.
    He will thus be able to restore 4 points of life to him.
 
 -🧙‍♂️The magician has 8 life points and a magic wand which allows him to make a "maxi bic mac" appear
    which flies directly into his opponent's throat.
    This will directly remove 6 life points from the latter.
    He can also choose one of his teammates and do one of his card tricks that made him so famous in Las Vegas.
    This will give  back 4 health points thanks to this short moment of distraction
    which will allow him for a moment to divert his thoughts from the hell of this fight.
 
 -🤡the clown has 6 life points. When he was younger his dearest wish was to make children laugh
    but nothing went as planned,his life was a failure.
    Result, today he is scary, very scary ...Using his oversized boxing glove that he keeps from a previous show,
    he hits hard and the lead he put inside has transformed this protection into a formidable weapon.
    If he sees one of his teammate in difficulty he will be able to burst into false tears
    and he will use this secret water reserve to rehydrate them and restore them 5 points of life.
 
 -🦸🏻‍♀️The superhero has 12 life points and an iPhone which is used mainly to take selfies
    but during her fights she uses the flash of the camera to dazzle her opponents ...
    so despite her slim figure she takes 3 life points with each of her attacks.
    If she prefers to take care of her teammates, none of them can resist one of her kisses.
    Even if the goods made remain to be proven from a medical point of view,
    the sudden heat that her teammates feel in their heart gives them 3 life points.
 
 -🎅🏻Santa has only 6 life points due to his poorly athletic body.
    Ok we must admit that even he doesn't really know how he got into this situation
    but now that his 3 enemies know his real name, he is determined not to leave any survivors among them.
    By taking a deep breath, he's able to make his abdomen oversized and thus take 6 points of life from his enemy
    by propelling him with his belly. His teammates call this "the blow of the airbag".
    And the metal buckle on his belt isn't there just to look pretty!
    Instead of attacking, he can choose to boost the morale of one of his weakened partners
    by singing him one of the many Christmas carols in his repertoire.
    This memory of a festive moment gives them back 6 life points.
 
 -🧝‍♀️The elf of the Bois de Boulogne has 5 health points and not much is known
    about his weapon which he tries to keep secret.
    We just know that his attack is sneaky, often comes from behind and hurts.
    It removes 5 life points.
    For his partners, he has another secret power which replenishes them with energy and gives them 8 life points.

 ## Chest box 🗃:
   A chest box can appear randomly during combat.
   It contains a weapon that the caracter must take.
   It will replace the one he owns until he dies or finds another chest box.
   There can be 3 different weapons.
   
    - 🖍 LightSaber Damage = 100 / Heal = 0
            * The lightSaber kill in one shot.
            In return, the owner of the LightSaber loses his healing ability.
            
    - 🦯 BrokenSword Damage = O / Heal = 0
            * The brokenSword is useless and cancels the attack and healing abilities
            of the character who only had to suffer the attacks or hope to find another chest box
            to be able to get rid of this poisoned gift.
            
    - 🧪 MagicPotion Damage = O / Heal = Max
            *The magic potion completely restores the life of the chosen character.
            On the other hand, the owner of the potion loses his attack abilities.
            
            ⚠️Warning⚠️:
            The magic potion has a special power. If it is used on a dead character ☠️ ,
            this one becomes a zombie 🧟‍♂️ and he recovers his starting points of life.
            He can no longer attack and heal but he can be selected by his owner in the hope of hitting a chest box
            that will give him a Lightsaber or a potion.
            (In the latter case, he can then in turn bring another member of his team back to life.
            The zombie can be chosen as target by the opposing player in order to be killed again.
 
 ## Rules of the game:
  - Player 1 chooses a name for his team and chooses 3 characters among the 6 available types
    (the same type can be selected several times and nothing prevents him from making a team
    composed of 3 ninjas for example.)
  - Player 2 do the same.
  - Player 1 chooses a character from his team.
    At this point, a chest box can appear with a weapon that will be assigned automatically to the character.
    Player 1 chooses if he wants to heal a character on his team (but he cannot self-heal the active character)
    or if he wants to attack a character from the opposing team.
  - The result of the healing or attack is calculated and applied to the life points of the selected character.
  - Player 2 takes his turn in the same way
  - The game ends when all the characters on a team are dead
